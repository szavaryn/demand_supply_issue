# demand_supply_issue
Consider we have a taxi service. The important part of our business is a supply/demand balance. We canâ€™t control demand but we can shift some supply to necessary hours to cover more demand during peaks. Here we have samples of supply and demand data over a few weeks in a single city:
- Supply dataset shows aggregated driver activity in a city for a given period.
- Demand dataset shows how many people saw a car in the app when setting the pickup marker on the map.
We're going to evaluate the current balance and estimate the additional number of drivers to reach currently uncovered demand.
